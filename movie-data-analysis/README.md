# Movie Data Analysis & Visualization Project üé¨

## üëã Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis and visualization of movie datasets, providing insights into various film industry trends and characteristics. It demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python.

## ‚ú® Key Features
-   **Data Loading & Initial Exploration:** Robust handling of movie datasets (e.g., `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`).
-   **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:** Advanced techniques for managing missing values, parsing complex JSON columns (like genres, cast, crew, keywords) into structured data.
-   **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new, insightful features (e.g., movie profit).
-   **Deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth investigation of distributions (e.g., average vote, popularity, vote count) and correlation analysis between financial metrics (budget, revenue) and audience reception.
-   **Diverse Data Visualization:** Generation of 7 insightful charts, including:
    -   Film Genre Distribution
    -   Movie Profit Distribution
    -   Annual Movie Release Trend
    -   Movie Average Vote Distribution
    -   Movie Popularity Distribution
    -   Movie Vote Count Distribution
    -   Correlation Heatmap for key financial and audience metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
-   Python 3.x
-   Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
-   NumPy (for numerical operations)
-   Matplotlib (for basic plotting)
-   Seaborn (for enhanced statistical data visualization)
-   Visual Studio Code (IDE)
-   Git & GitHub (Version control)

## üöÄ How to Run (Local Setup)
1.  **Clone the main repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/LinneaShao/my_dev_projects.git](https://github.com/LinneaShao/my_dev_projects.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into this project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my_dev_projects/movie-data-analysis
    ```
3.  **Ensure you have the dataset:** Place `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` in this directory.
4.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
5.  **Install the required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```
6.  **Run the Python script**:
    ```bash
    python3 movie_analysis.py
    ```
*(Note: Charts will be displayed and saved as .png files in the project directory.)*

## üìö Learning Outcomes & Future Plans
This project has significantly enhanced my skills in end-to-end data analysis, advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and compelling data visualization. I aim to continue exploring predictive modeling and interactive dashboard development.
